🔀 Git: Rebase vs Merge
Working with Git branches often involves integrating changes from one branch into another. Git provides two primary methods to do this: merge and rebase.

🚀 Merge
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
✅ What It Does:
Combines the histories of two branches.

Creates a new merge commit if the branches have diverged.

📈 Visual Example:
Before merge:

text
Copy
Edit
A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature-branch)
After git merge main on feature-branch:


A---B---C---------M (feature-branch)
     \           /
      D---E-----/
M is the new merge commit combining both histories.

✅ Pros:
Preserves full history of what happened and when.

Great for collaborative projects where preserving context is valuable.

❌ Cons:
History can get messy with many merge commits.

Not ideal for short-lived branches or solo work.

🔄 Rebase

git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
✅ What It Does:
Rewrites the feature-branch to appear as if it was based on the latest main.

Applies your commits on top of main, one by one.

📈 Visual Example:
Before rebase:


A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature-branch)
After git rebase main:


A---B---C---D'---E' (feature-branch)
D' and E' are new commits (rewritten versions of D and E) applied after C.

✅ Pros:
Cleaner, linear history.

Makes it seem like your work was built on the latest main.

Ideal for short-lived branches and pull requests.

❌ Cons:
Rewrites history — don’t rebase shared/public branches without coordination.

Conflicts during rebase must be resolved commit-by-commit.

💡 When to Use What?

Situation	Use Merge	Use Rebase
Collaborating with others	✅	⚠️ Only if coordinated
Cleaning up local branch before PR	❌	✅
Preserving full history	✅	❌
Want clean, linear history	❌	✅
💻 Common Workflow with Rebase

git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease
⚠️ Use --force-with-lease when pushing rebased branches to avoid overwriting others' work accidentally.
