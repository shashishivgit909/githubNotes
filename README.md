🔀 Git: Rebase vs Merge
Working with Git branches often involves integrating changes from one branch into another. Git provides two primary methods to do this: merge and rebase.

🚀 Merge
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
✅ What It Does:
Combines the histories of two branches.

Creates a new merge commit if the branches have diverged.

📈 Visual Example:
Before merge:

text
Copy
Edit
A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature-branch)
After git merge main on feature-branch:


A---B---C---------M (feature-branch)
     \           /
      D---E-----/
M is the new merge commit combining both histories.

✅ Pros:
Preserves full history of what happened and when.

Great for collaborative projects where preserving context is valuable.

❌ Cons:
History can get messy with many merge commits.

Not ideal for short-lived branches or solo work.

🔄 Rebase

git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
✅ What It Does:
Rewrites the feature-branch to appear as if it was based on the latest main.

Applies your commits on top of main, one by one.

📈 Visual Example:
Before rebase:


A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature-branch)
After git rebase main:


A---B---C---D'---E' (feature-branch)
D' and E' are new commits (rewritten versions of D and E) applied after C.

✅ Pros:
Cleaner, linear history.

Makes it seem like your work was built on the latest main.

Ideal for short-lived branches and pull requests.

❌ Cons:
Rewrites history — don’t rebase shared/public branches without coordination.

Conflicts during rebase must be resolved commit-by-commit.

💡 When to Use What?

Situation	Use Merge	Use Rebase
Collaborating with others	✅	⚠️ Only if coordinated
Cleaning up local branch before PR	❌	✅
Preserving full history	✅	❌
Want clean, linear history	❌	✅
💻 Common Workflow with Rebase

git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease
⚠️ Use --force-with-lease when pushing rebased branches to avoid overwriting others' work accidentally.

##  Interview Questions:

terms: 1. working directory(before "git add") : your local code , 
       2. staging area: code goes after "git add" ,
       3. after commit , code goes to git history for this repo:  
# git reset :
1. git reset --soft HEAD~1
✅ What it does:
=>Moves the HEAD pointer back by one commit (that's what HEAD~1 means).
Keeps your changes in the staging area (aka the "index").
It’s as if you never committed — but your changes are still ready to be committed again. 

2. git reset --mixed HEAD~1 (default if no flag is given)
✅ What it does:
Also moves HEAD back by one commit.
Unstages the changes (moves them from the staging area back to the working directory).
Your code is still there, just no longer staged for commit.

🧠 When to use it:
=>You want to undo the last commit and double-check or modify the changes before committing again.
You accidentally staged files that shouldn’t be in the commit.

📦 State After Command:
Commit: Reverted.
Staging Area: ❌ Empty — nothing is staged.
Working Directory: ✅ Your code is still the


Reset Types Compared (Visual Table)
git reset --soft	❌ Reverts last commit	✅ Keeps staged changes	✅ Keeps your code as-is
git reset --mixed	❌ Reverts last commit	❌ Unstages changes	✅ Keeps your code as-is
git reset --hard	❌ Reverts last commit	❌ Unstages everything	❌ Deletes all your code changes

🔥 Command Summary
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Undo commit, keep changes staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1  # Undo commit, unstage changes (keep in working dir)
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # Undo commit, delete all changes!
